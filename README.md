# Linting and Formatting Demo

Demonstrating some tools elaborated on in [a post on my blog](https://finnnannestad.com/blog/nitpicking).
This is just a bare-bones React project built with Vite. The code itself is just to enable demonstration of the various linting and formatting tools.

## Tooling

This repo contains the following tools, each with some config that I recommend using.

1. EditorConfig
2. Knip
3. ESLint
4. Prettier
5. TypeScript (specifically some recommended config in `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`)
6. Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit checks
7. Github workflow running checks
8. Recommended VSCode extensions
