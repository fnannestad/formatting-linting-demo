# Linting and Formatting Demo

Demonstrating some tools and configurations elaborated on in [a post on my blog](https://finnnannestad.com/blog/linting-and-formatting).

This is just a bare-bones React project built with Vite. The code itself is just to enable demonstration of the various tools.

## Tooling

Linting and formatting tools:

1. EditorConfig
2. Prettier
3. ESLint
4. Knip
5. tsconfig (not exactly a tool, however useful configuration in `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`)

Other settings:

1. Visual Studio Code recommended extensions and settings
2. Pre-commit hooks
3. GitHub workflow
